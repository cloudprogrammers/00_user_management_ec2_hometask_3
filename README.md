# Linux Users and Groups Management
Welcome to this comprehensive exercise series designed to guide you through creating a practical, real-world Bash script for managing user accounts on a Linux system. Throughout these exercises, you will develop a script that not only creates user accounts with superuser privileges but also intelligently handles input arguments to set usernames and comments, and even auto-generates passwords for account security. 

The goal is to craft a fully functional script that embodies best practices in script development, error handling, and security measures. By the end of this series, you will have a robust tool at your disposal for efficiently managing user accountsâ€”a skill set highly relevant in various IT and cloud computing roles.

## _What you will learn_

- **Script Execution with Superuser Privileges** Understand the importance of running scripts with superuser privileges for tasks requiring system modifications, and how to check for and enforce this within your scripts.
- **Command Line Argument Handling** Dive into processing command line arguments to enhance script flexibility. Learn how to use the first argument as a username and concatenate remaining arguments as a comment for the account, adapting your script to varied input scenarios.
- **Effective User Feedback and Usage Instructions** Craft clear, helpful usage instructions and feedback messages within your scripts. This ensures users understand how to utilize your script correctly and are informed of any errors or necessary actions.

## Prerequisites
Before you start, make sure you have the following installed:

- At least one EC2 instance available and running in your AWS account.

# EXERCISES

## Exercise 1: Introduction to Linux Users and Groups

**Objective**
Explore the process of managing users and groups in Linux. By creating a new user and group, you'll understand their roles and the impact of permissions on system security.

**Task 1: Creating a New User and Group:**
**Create a New Group** Start by creating a new group named **heroes**. Use the command:
```sh
sudo groupadd heroes
```
[Shebang Explained](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xOhWo0Wz0ur-8l34e8K4DtKxyQ8dyvVNinGC7kgSF5U/edit#heading=h.t9kotiz18puv)

**2. Create a New User:** 
Now, create a new user named **hero** and add them to the **heroes** group. Use the **-m** option to create a home directory for the user, and **-G** to specify the group:
```sh
sudo useradd -m -G heroes hero
```

**Set a Password for the New User:** Assign a password to the hero user by running:
```
sudo passwd hero
```
**Task 2: Working with Directories and Permissions**

**1. Create a Directory and File:** 
First, navigate to the **/tmp** directory. We will be making our experiment here. It's a catalog for all temporary stuff.
Create a new directory named `hero_files`.
Inside `hero_files`, create a text file named message.txt and write "Hello there!" into it.
All the commands are here:
```
cd /tmp
mkdir hero_files
echo "Hello there!" > hero_files/message.txt
```

**Set Group Ownership and Permissions:**
Change the ownership of `hero_files` and its contents to belong to the heroes group.
```
sudo chown :heroes hero_files/
```
Set permissions to allow read and write access to the file only for users in the `heroes` group.
```
sudo chmod 770 hero_files/
sudo chmod 660 hero_files/message.txt
```

**Task 3: Test the Access Control**

Attempt to read and write to `message.txt` as a user not in the heroes group. You should be denied access in both cases:
```
cat /tmp/hero_files/message.txt # READ operation
echo "New message" > /tmp/hero_files/message.txt # WRITE operation
```

How do we solve this ? 
Well, we have 2 options. Only users who belong to `heroes` group can read, write and execute the files inside `/tmp/hero_files` directory.
First, we can switch now to the user which belongs to the `heroes` group:
```
su - hero
```
And try to access files. Do it now, and see what effect does it have on the command output. 

The second option is to add the current user to `heroes` group. By doing this, the user we are logged as in, will gain all the privileges that the `heroes` group has. 
Use the `whoami` command to display the current username.
```
whoami
```
Alternatively, the id command provides more detailed information about the user, including their groups.
```
id
```

Adding the current user to the heroes group will grant them the permissions associated with that group, specifically the ability to read and write to the message.txt file in the `/tmp/hero_files/` directory.

**Add User to the Group:**
Use the usermod command to add your current user to the heroes group. You'll need to replace <your-username> with the username you identified in Step 1.
```
sudo usermod -aG heroes <your-username>
```
Note: The `-aG` option appends the user to the specified group without removing them from their existing groups.

**Test the Access Control Again** :
After adding your user to the heroes group, you need to log out and log back in for the group changes to take effect. This is necessary because the current session does not automatically refresh group memberships.
**Log Out and Log In:**
Depending on your environment, logging out and back in can be done through the GUI or by closing and reopening your terminal session.

**Verify Group Membership:**
```
id
```

**Test File Access again**
Attempt to read and write to message.txt again. Now that your user is part of the heroes group, you should have the necessary permissions

```
cat /tmp/hero_files/message.txt
echo "New message" >> /tmp/hero_files/message.txt
cat /tmp/hero_files/message.txt
```

## Exercise 2: Building a User Management Script - Part 1
**Objective**
This exercise is designed to guide you through the initial steps of creating a Bash script for user management on a Linux system. You'll start with a script structure that checks for superuser privileges and reads user input. Your task is to complete the script by adding a user based on the provided input, managing the password, and ensuring the user changes the password at the first login.

**1. Handle User Input** :
Here's the initial structure of your script, add-local-user.sh. This part of the script ensures it's run with superuser privileges and collects necessary information from the user:
**Task:** Understand why it's crucial to run certain scripts with superuser privileges, especially when modifying system settings or managing user accounts. 
Before going further, see [the study material](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gMYi7TxPrvmNcBsFKtygX6Sy0uiidkMfSDDO8XnX0kk/edit?usp=sharing).

```
#!/bin/bash

# Ensure the script is run with superuser privileges
if [[ "${UID}" -ne 0 ]]; then
    echo 'Please run the script using sudo or as a root.'
    exit 1 # Exit with an error
fi
```

**2: Reading User Input**
**Task 1:** You will be creating an account with data collected from user.
Here is a quick refresher on how to parse user input and save it to variable.

```
# Prompt for user input
read -p 'Enter the username to create: ' USER_NAME
read -p 'Enter the name of the person or application that will be using this account: ' COMMENT
read -p 'Enter the password to use for the account: ' PASSWORD
```

**2: Create user and password**

**Task 1:** 
Add the User: Use the collected input (`USER_NAME` and `COMMENT`) to add a new user to the system. Remember to create a home directory for the user.
```
useradd -c "${COMMENT}" -m ${USER_NAME}
```

**Task 2:** Check if `useradd` Succeeded. 
This is your part. 
You need to verify in the script, whether the user creation process succeeded.
Here is the
[material for reference.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rjk55kJ_JVwFoNCq018LBULVIjBkWHYj3N5Z0bk4a4o/edit?usp=sharing)

**Task 3:** Set the User Password
Securely add the password for the newly created account. Be cautious of how you handle the password in your script.

```
echo ${PASSWORD} | passwd --stdin ${USER_NAME}
```

**Task 4:**
This is your part. 
Your goal is to complete and test out the working script.
>Requirements:
**1.** Ensure the Password Add Was Successful
Similar to step 2, check the success of the password assignment and notify if there's an error.
**1.** Enforce Password Change on First Login
Use the `passwd` command to force the user to change their password the next time they log in.
**1.** Display Account Details
Similar to step 2, check the success of the password assignment and notify if there's an error.

**Testing:** Test your script with different inputs to ensure it behaves as expected under various scenarios.


## Exercise 3: Building a User Management Script - Part 2
**Objective**
Refine your user management script by adjusting it to accept the command-line arguments instead of relying on capturing user input. Incorporate a usage statement that guides the user on how to properly execute the script, especially when required arguments, like the account name, are missing. This exercise teaches you to improve script usability and provide clearer communication in your tools, an essential skill for script development and user support.

**Tasks**

**Task 1:** Check for the Presence of an Account Name
Modify the Script to Check Arguments:
Immediately after ensuring the script is run with superuser privileges, add a check to see if an account name was provided as an argument.
If not, display a usage statement and exit with status 1.

```
if [[ "${#}" -lt 1]]; then
    echo "Usage: ${0} USER_NAME [COMMENT]..."
    echo "Create an account on the local system with the name of USER_NAME and a name of person or application that will use the script with COMMENT."
    echo "Example: ${0} test_user test_user@company.com"
    exit 1
fi
```

See, that we use one of the [special variables.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rjk55kJ_JVwFoNCq018LBULVIjBkWHYj3N5Z0bk4a4o/edit?usp=sharing) in Linux to reach our goal.
We also use `-lt` which means literally `less than`.

**Task 2**: Clear Usage Statement 
Modify the message

>"Create an account.." 

to better fit your particular taste. You can provide clearer examples.

**Task 3** Test your script:
* Attempt to run your script without supplying an account name to ensure that your usage statement is displayed as expected.
* Execute the script with an account name to verify that it proceeds as when the necessary information is provided.


**Task 4** Dynamically assign variables:
* Assign the first argument as the username
```
USER_NAME="${1}"
```

Use all remaining arguments as the comment for the account
The `shift` command shifts the positional parameters to the left, making $2 become $1, $3 become $2, etc.
Here, it's used to remove the first argument (username) from the list, leaving only the comment.
 ```
shift
COMMENT="${*}"
```
* Now proceed to create the user with the parsed username and comment
```
useradd -c "${COMMENT}" -m ${USER_NAME}
```

## Exercise 4: Building a User Management Script - Part 3 - generate strong, random passwords

This set of exercises builds upon your existing script by utilizing command line arguments for user and comment input and make the password generation automatic for the new account. These features improve user experience, ensure security of the passwords and increase automation level.

**Objective**
Implement a feature to automatically generate a password for the new account.

**Tasks:**
* Implement a function or a one-liner within your script to generate a random password.
* Ensure the password meets common security criteria (length, complexity).

# Key Points to Remember

**Difference between system and regular users** System users are created to run specific services, while regular users are created for human users or to run specific applications.

**Group management:** Groups are used to organize users that share common access and permission requirements.
Essential options when creating user accounts: The useradd command includes several options that are crucial for customizing the creation of user accounts.

**Superuser Privileges** Essential for scripts that alter system configurations or manage user accounts to ensure they execute with the necessary permissions.

**Handling User Input** Mastery in processing command-line arguments for setting usernames and comments enhances script versatility and user experience.

**Error Handling** Implementing checks for command execution status (${?}) and providing informative feedback are crucial for robust scripts.

**Usage Statements** Clear, informative usage statements guide users on proper script execution, improving usability and reducing errors.

**Command Substitution and Special Variables** Utilizing Bash features like command substitution ($(...)) and special variables (**$1**, **$@**, etc.) allows for dynamic and flexible script operations.
